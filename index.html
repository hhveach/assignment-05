                  <h1>About the MFAH</h1>
                  <p>
                    Established in 1900, the MFAH is the largest cultural institution
                    in the southwest region. The Museum’s main campus is located in
                    the heart of Houston’s Museum District, and comprises the Audrey
                    Jones Beck Building, the Caroline Wiess Law Building, the Glassell
                    School of Art, and the Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen Sculpture Garden.
                    Nearby, two remarkable house museums—Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens,
                    and Rienzi—present collections of American and European decorative arts.
                    Resources that can be found throughout the MFAH include a repertory cinema,
                    two significant research libraries, public archives, and a conservation
                    and storage facility. The encyclopedic collections of the MFAH cover world
                    cultures dating from antiquity to the present and include in-depth holdings
                    of American art, European paintings, pre-Columbian and African gold, decorative
                    arts and design, photography, prints and drawings, Modern and Contemporary
                    painting and sculpture, and Latin American art. The MFAH is also home to the
                    International Center for the Arts of the Americas (ICAA), a leading research
                    institute for 20th-century Latin American and Latino art.

                <h1>Architectural Legacy</h1>
                <p>
                  The MFAH campus unites the brilliant architectural and design work of
                  Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Isamu Noguchi, and Rafael Moneo, part of a
                  75-year legacy of inspired commissions that spans from 1924—and the
                  construction of the original Museum building designed by William Ward
                  Watkin in the Neoclassical style—to the year 2000, when the Museum
                  completed the Rafael Moneo-designed Audrey Jones Beck Building.

                    well as the sculpture garden by Isamu Noguchi, establishing
                    a 14-acre public campus in the heart of Houston’s Museum District.

                          <p>By the mid-1970s, the Museum needed a new facility for its
                            school of art to accommodate the growing student body. Under
                            the guidance of Museum director William C. Agee, and with a
                            generous donation from Alfred Glassell, Jr., a plan for an
                            approximately 42,000-square-foot building was drawn up by
                            architects Eugene Aubry and R. Nolen Willis of the prominent
                            Houston firm S. I. Morris and Associates. The building—a
                            two-story space made from concrete and glass-block, and located
                            one block north of the Museum—represented the first time that
                            the school had a home of its own in its 52-year history. The
                            Glassell School of Art opened to the public on January 13, 1979.
